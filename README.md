- 👋 Hi, I’m @Circlecheckerboard
- 👀 I’m interested in monetizing my patented game board design using an open source checkers or chess engine and developing an Android/iOS mobile app and/or Windows-based desktop program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the +/- of each program's develoment time and associated expense.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on its development with a full partner (team or individual) following a consult to determine qualifications and dedication to its launch and financial success.
